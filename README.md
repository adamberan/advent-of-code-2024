# advent-of-code-2024

My solutions of the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, except I plan to work on it in 2025, and I plan to finish one challenge per week.
However, it is not difficult to predict that it will take more time than this. Hence, the “expected time to finish” chart:

- Idealistic (constant complexity): 1 challenge per week ⇒ total of 25 weeks.
- Optimistic (linear complexity): challenge no. *k* takes *k* weeks to complete ⇒ total of 1 + 2 + ··· + 25 = 25·26/2 = 325 weeks.
- Realistic (exponential complexity): first challenge takes 1 week, each next challenge takes 2 times more time than the previous challenge ⇒ total of 1 + 2 + 4 + ··· + 2<sup>24</sup> = 2<sup>25</sup> - 1 = 33,554,431 weeks.

I hope it is not too optimistic to hope for the optimistic outcome! ❄
